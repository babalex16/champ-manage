# Development of a Cross-Platform Championship Management Application
## A BSc Thesis project developed by Alexandr Babii

In todayâ€™s smartphone-dominated era, it has become a necessity for businesses to have a mobile app in order to effectively connect with customers. Having a cross-platform application is preferred because it works with different devices and attracts a wider audience. This thesis aims to showcase the power of RESTful web APIs in cross-platform solutions.

To achieve this, a championship management platform is developed using ASP.NET Web API as the back end, React as the front end, and MAUI for an Android application. The goal of the application is to simplify event management procedures, offering both organizers and participants an intuitive and effective experience, regardless of their preferred
platform.

The application provides event organizers with powerful tools for creating championships, modifying championship details, and adding different categories based on the age, weight, and proficiency level of the athlete. They also have access to the functionality of bracket creation, registration management, and running matches in a dedicated sports timer. Athletes benefit from a simple registration process, real-time updates on match progress, and convenient access to information about upcoming matches.
